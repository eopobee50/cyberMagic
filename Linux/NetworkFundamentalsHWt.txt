Networking Fundamentals Homework: Rocking your Network!

Phase 1: "I'd like to Teach the World to Ping"

The fping command used is fping -g <IP Address>
Determine the IPs for the Hollywood office and run fping against the IP ranges in order to determine which IP is accepting connections.

fping -g 15.199.95.91/28
 
As per above screenshot, the only IP accepting connections is 167.172.144.11/32
Vulnerabilities - "Ping" is mostly harmless. The main security-related issues is when requests from fake source address ("spoofing"), make a target machine send relatively large packets to another host.
Mitigation -  Disable the IP/domain from being pinged. 
 The findings occurred on the network layer as Ping uses IP addresses and IPs are used on the Network Layer.
=======================================
Phase 2: "Some Syn for Nothin`"
The command used is sudo nmap-sS 167.172.144.11/32

Port 22 is open
Vulnerabilities - Open ports become targets from hackers/cybercriminals to exploit and brute force the network and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Mitigation - Identify the open ports through scanning, understand the use of the ports and close have them closed.
 The findings occurred on the transport layer as the transport layer is responsible for sending SYN requests to the network.
======================================
Phase 3: "I Feel a DNS Change Comin' On"
 I used the ssh command to log back into IP that responded to the pings from Phase1
ssh jimi@167.172.144.11/32
I terminated my session with the exit command
 
I run the nslookup command to determine the real domain of the IP address.
As per the screenshot the real domain is yahoo.com 

Add your findings to your summary and be sure to indicate which OSI layer they were found on.
 The findings occurred on the Application layer which allows remote login to operate.

==========================
Phase 4: "ShARP Dressed Man"

I sshed the server that was accepting connections 
ssh jim@167.172.144.11/32
I used cd /etc to get to the same directory as the configuration file from Phase 3 and did an ls to look into the /etc folder 

 I found one of the files listed as packetcaptureinfo.txt

 I  looked inside of the text file by using the cat command

Analyzed the file in wireshark and found the following: 
Using the filter http.request.method==”GET” these were the websites visited :

Using the filter http.request.method == "POST", the screenshot below shows what was sent out from the website  

Found a duplicate IP address with a mac address that belongs to the hacker 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1. this is used to send spoofed ARP messages meaning all future traffic intended for the good MAC address 00:0c:29:0f:71:a3 will go to the hacker's MAC address instead. This will result in ARP poisoning attack.

 
There are mitigation methods to protect against an ARP poisoning attack. These include:
Creating static ARP entries, rather than dynamic ARP entries.
Using third-party tools can identify and alert potential ARP poisoning attacks.
  These findings occurred on the Application layer for HTTP and Data link layer for the ARP where the broadsent is sent. which allows remote login to operate.
